# Contributing

We welcome pull requests and feature additions, especially as part of [Hacktoberfest][Hacktoberfest].

## Please don't send a PR without commenting on an issue first

We welcome contributions, but _please don't send a pull requests out of the blue_. It creates unpleasant race conditions between concurrent human processes :wink: Read on.

## TL;DR

 1. Pick an [issue][issues],
 1. Comment that you want to work on it.
 1. [Fork][fork].
 1. Reference the issue in [commit messages][fixes].
 1. Send PR
 1. Please be receptive to changes in Review.
 1. `PR_REMAINING_FOR_SHIRT--` [;)][Hacktoberfest]

## Difficulty

I'd like to foster a welcoming atmosphere, especially for new contributors.

This project in particular has a lot of easy-to-medium problems to solve in node and is well-suited to beginners.

## How to work (long version)

Please,
 1. Review the [Issue tracker][issues] and pick an issue that looks interesting to you. This project is not on a tight deadline, so feel free to take some time to come up with an appropriate, idiomatic and efficient solution.
 1. Then _tell us_ you would like to work on it _in the issue itself_. This lets the maintainers and other contributors know that the issue is in progress, and prevents very unfortunate race conditions where several people work on the same issue in a silo.
 1. Create a [fork][fork].
 1. Work. See Stack Overflow for help.
 1. When making your commits, please reference the issue number [in the commit message itself using fixes syntax][fixes].
 1. Please run `npm test` and make sure all tests pass (even though [Travis][travis] will also check).
 1. Submit a pull request (preferably [between 1 and 30 October][Hacktoberfest]).
 1. Be receptive to changes in Review and push new commits if necessary.
