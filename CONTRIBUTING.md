## Difficulty

I'd like to foster a welcoming atmosphere, especially for new contributors.

This project in particular has a lot of easy-to-medium problems to solve in node and is well-suited to beginners.

## How to work (long version)

Please,
 1. Review the [Issue tracker][issues] and pick an issue that looks interesting to you. This project is not on a tight deadline, so feel free to take some time to come up with an appropriate, idiomatic and efficient solution.
 1. Then _tell us_ you would like to work on it _in the issue itself_. This lets the maintainers and other contributors know that the issue is in progress, and prevents very unfortunate race conditions where several people work on the same issue in a silo.
 1. Create a [fork][fork].
 1. Work. See Stack Overflow for help.
 1. When making your commits, please reference the issue number [in the commit message itself using fixes syntax][fixes].
 1. Please run `npm test` and make sure all tests pass (even though [Travis][travis] will also check).
 1. Submit a pull request (preferably [between 1 and 30 October][Hacktoberfest]).
 1. Be receptive to changes in Review and push new commits if necessary.
